protectedStorage is meant to work with files saved in 7z archive, encrypted with password.

It supposed to help with a standard scenario: 
1. unpack archive 
2. edit/read files
3. repack archive with updated files

But with protectedStorage unpack/repack operations can be done automatically.

That was the idea.. 

Current status:
The work on project is in progress.
